## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

### **Issue 1: App Not Installing**
```bash
# Check Docker services
docker compose ps

# Check app directory exists
docker compose exec backend ls -la /home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext_mz/

# Check permissions
docker compose exec backend ls -la /home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext_mz/
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure ERPNext services are running
- Check app directory permissions
- Verify app structure is correct

### **Issue 2: Custom Fields Not Showing**
```bash
# Check custom fields exist
docker compose exec backend bench --site your-site.com console -c "
import frappe
custom_fields = frappe.get_all('Custom Field', filters={'app': 'erpnext_mz'})
print(f'Found {len(custom_fields)} custom fields')
"
```

**Solutions:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check user permissions
- Verify custom fields were created

### **Issue 3: Import Errors**
```bash
# Test app imports
docker compose exec backend bench --site your-site.com console -c "
import erpnext_mz
print('‚úÖ App imports successfully')
"
```

**Solutions:**
- Check app structure
- Verify all required files exist
- Check Python syntax in modules

### **Issue 4: SAF-T Generation Fails**
```bash
# Test SAF-T generation
docker compose exec backend bench --site your-site.com console -c "
from erpnext_mz.modules.tax_compliance.saf_t_generator import generate_monthly_saf_t
try:
    companies = frappe.get_all('Company', limit=1)
    if companies:
        result = generate_monthly_saf_t(companies[0].name, 2025, 1)
        print('‚úÖ Success:', result)
    else:
        print('‚ùå No companies found')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'‚ùå Error: {str(e)}')
"
```

**Solutions:**
- Check company configuration
- Verify file permissions
- Check disk space
