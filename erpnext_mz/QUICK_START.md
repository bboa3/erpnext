# ðŸš€ Quick Start (Clean Skeleton)

This clean skeleton has no setup scripts, fixtures, or schedules. Install like any Frappe app:

```bash
bench get-app path/to/erpnext_mz
bench --site your-site install-app erpnext_mz
```

Optional: Use the SAF-T generator manually from a bench console when you wire it later.
